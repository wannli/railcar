Recalling its resolution 50/70 Q of 12 December 1995, in which the General Assembly noted that the States Parties to the Treaty affirmed the need to continue to move with determination towards the full realization and effective implementation of the provisions of the Treaty, and accordingly adopted a set of principles and objectives,

Treaty, principles and objectives for nuclear non‑proliferation and disarmament, and extension of the Treaty,2

Reaffirming the resolution on the Middle East adopted on 11 May 1995 by the 1995 Review and Extension Conference, in which the Conference reaffirmed the importance of the early realization of universal adherence to the Treaty and placement of nuclear facilities under full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards,

Taking into consideration the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States, in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference, to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament, to which all States Parties to the Treaty are committed under article VI of the Treaty,

Expressing concern that the ninth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held from 27 April to 22 May 2015, as well as the tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non‑Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, held from 1 to 26 August 2022, were not able to reach agreement on a substantive final document,

1. Recalls that the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons reaffirmed the continued validity of the practical steps agreed to in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons;5

2. Determines to pursue practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to implement article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and paragraphs 3 and 4 (c) of the decision on principles and objectives for nuclear non‑proliferation and disarmament of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons;

3. Calls for practical steps, as agreed to at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to be taken by all nuclear-weapon States, that would lead to nuclear disarmament in a way that promotes international stability and, based on the principle of undiminished security for all:

(a) Further efforts to be made by the nuclear-weapon States to reduce their nuclear arsenals unilaterally;

(b) Increased transparency by the nuclear-weapon States with regard to nuclear weapons capabilities and the implementation of agreements pursuant to article VI of

(f) The engagement, as soon as appropriate, of all the nuclear-weapon States in the process leading to the total elimination of their nuclear weapons;

4. Notes that the 2000 and 2010 Review Conferences agreed that legally binding security assurances by the five nuclear-weapon States to the non‑nuclear- weapon States Parties to the Treaty strengthen the nuclear non‑proliferation regime;
