Welcoming the successful convening of the Preparatory Meeting of States on the Global Framework for Through-life Conventional Ammunition Management, held from 23 to 27 June 2025 pursuant to resolution 79/54, and its report contained in document A/AC.299/2025/PM/1, and the recommendations contained therein,

Recalling the final report of the open-ended working group established pursuant to resolution 76/233, contained in document A/78/111, and the recommendations contained therein,

Recalling also the reports of the Group of Governmental Experts established pursuant to resolution 72/55,1 of the Group of Governmental Experts established pursuant to resolution 61/72,2 and of the Group of Experts established pursuant to resolution 52/38 J,3

2 See A/63/182.

3 See A/54/155.

Recalling, in its resolution 78/47, its decision to adopt the Global Framework for Through-life Conventional Ammunition Management,4 which is a cooperative framework that is voluntary and contains a set of political commitments for strengthening and promoting existing initiatives on, and addressing existing gaps in, through-life conventional ammunition management, and emphasizing the importance of its early and full implementation,

Expressing grave concern over the risks posed by the diversion of conventional ammunition of all types and calibres to unauthorized recipients, including criminals, organized criminal groups and terrorists, their trafficking into illicit markets, including their subsequent use in the manufacture of improvised explosive devices, as well as their contribution to the intensity and duration of armed conflict, armed violence, including gender-based armed violence, around the world, and the threat that their diversion and illicit trafficking poses to peace, security, stability and sustainable development at the national, subregional, regional and global levels,

Expressing grave concern also over the destruction caused by unplanned explosions of conventional ammunition at ammunition sites, which claim thousands of lives, disrupt communities’ livelihoods, and can generate severe humanitarian, human rights, socioeconomic, environmental and public health impacts,

Recognizing that gaps exist to achieving a discernible reduction in the risks and impacts arising from the ineffective through-life management of conventional ammunition around the world, extending from the point of manufacture, through pre‑transfer, transfer, relocation and transport, stockpiling and recovery, to their eventual use or disposal, and to this end stressing the importance of addressing the safety and security risks and impacts emanating from the ineffective through-life management of conventional ammunition at the global level in a comprehensive manner to contribute to maintaining international peace and security,

Recognizing also the need for the full, equal, meaningful and effective participation of women in decision-making and implementation processes related to through-life conventional ammunition management, and encouraging mainstreaming a gender perspective into policy and practice to address the differential impacts of the safety and security aspects of conventional ammunition on women, men, girls and boys,

Reaffirming the right of each State to legally manufacture, acquire, stockpile, manage and transfer conventional ammunition, including for its self-defence and security needs, as well as for its capacity to participate in peace operations, in a manner consistent with the Charter of the United Nations,

Recognizing that responsibility for addressing the risks associated with ineffective through-life conventional ammunition management falls to States, consistent with national laws, and underlining the importance of all States assuming strong national ownership in the through-life management of conventional ammunition,

Recognizing also the importance of international cooperation and assistance in pursuing and supporting safe, secure and sustainable through-life conventional ammunition management nationally, subregionally, regionally and globally,

Stressing the need for international cooperation among all States and other relevant stakeholders on through-life conventional ammunition management, and acknowledging the support that they can provide, where appropriate and feasible, to States in addressing the risks posed by ineffective through-life conventional ammunition management,

4 A/78/111, annex.

Recognizing the urgent necessity for assistance, where requested, appropriate and feasible, including technology transfers, technical, material, financial, legal assistance, or expertise for capacity-building and knowledge management, to support and facilitate efforts at the national, subregional, regional and global levels to assess and address the risks associated with ineffective through-life conventional ammunition management, and in this regard underscoring the importance of a comprehensive and sustainable approach,

Recalling with appreciation the work of the SaferGuard programme,5 managed by the Office for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat, to improve the safe, secure and sustainable through-life management of conventional ammunition, and encouraging the use, as appropriate, of the voluntary International Ammunition Technical Guidelines,

Noting with appreciation the ongoing work of the Ammunition Management Advisory Team to support interested States in the safe and secure management of ammunition through the provision of technical advice and services,

Taking note of discussions with regard to the issue of conventional ammunition in the framework of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects6 and the International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner,
Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons,7 Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War
(Protocol V)8 to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects,9 and of the requirement of the Arms Trade Treaty 10 that States Parties thereto shall designate competent national authorities in order to have an effective and transparent national control system to regulate the transfer of relevant ammunition and munitions, as well as the work and measures pursued at the regional and subregional levels,

Recognizing the relevance of regional and subregional mechanisms that address through-life conventional ammunition management,

Taking note of the Secretary-General’s New Agenda for Peace11 and of the actions proposed therein to reduce the human cost of weapons,

Recalling that Member States decided in the Pact for the Future12 to address existing gaps in through-life conventional ammunition management to reduce the dual risks of unplanned conventional ammunition explosions and the diversion and illicit trafficking of conventional ammunition to unauthorized recipients, including to criminals, organized criminal groups and terrorists, and highlighting the role of the Global Framework for Through-life Conventional Ammunition Management in this regard,

Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General on through-life conventional ammunition management13 pursuant to resolution 79/54,
