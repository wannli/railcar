United Nations

General Assembly Distr.: General 5 December 2025

Eightieth session Agenda item 99 (mm) General and complete disarmament: artificial intelligence in the military domain and its implications for international peace and security

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 1 December 2025

[on the report of the First Committee (A/80/534, para. 7)]

80/58. Artificial intelligence in the military domain and its implications for international peace and security

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolution 79/239 of 24 December 2024,

Affirming that international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, applies to matters governed by it that occur throughout the life cycle of artificial intelligence capabilities as well as the systems that they enable in the military domain,

Stressing the importance of ensuring the responsible application of artificial intelligence in the military domain, which, for the purpose of this resolution, includes human-centric, accountable, safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence used in compliance with international law,

Bearing in mind that this resolution focuses on the whole life cycle of artificial intelligence capabilities applied in the military domain, including the stages of pre‑design, design, development, evaluation, testing, deployment, use, sale, procurement, operation and decommissioning, and that this resolution does not cover artificial intelligence in the civilian domain,

Mindful that States have started to increasingly integrate artificial intelligence into a broad array of applications in the military domain, including into weapons, weapon systems and other means and methods of warfare, as well as systems that support military operations, and noting its operational use,

Cognizant of potential implications for international peace and security, in particular in the fields of arms control, disarmament and non‑proliferation, resulting

from developments related to the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain,

Recognizing the need to enhance a shared understanding of potential effects of artificial intelligence in the military domain to harness the benefits while minimizing the risks of its use, and the need to further assess them,

Mindful of the potential opportunities and benefits of artificial intelligence in the military domain, such as in the areas of compliance with international humanitarian law, including protection of civilians and civilian objects in armed conflict,

Mindful also of the challenges and concerns that the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain raises from humanitarian, legal, security, technological and ethical perspectives, as well as the possible impact of such applications on international security and stability, including the risk of an arms race, miscalculation, lowering the threshold for conflict and escalation of conflict and acquisition by non‑State actors, and noting the possible consequences with regard to, inter alia, gender, racial, age or social aspects that could potentially be caused by bias in data sets or other algorithmic biases of artificial intelligence,

Mindful further of the need for States to implement appropriate safeguards, including measures that relate to human judgment and control over the use of force, in order to ensure the responsible application of artificial intelligence in the military domain consistent with their respective obligations under applicable international law,

Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on current developments in science and technology and their potential impact on international security and disarmament efforts,1

Recognizing the need to narrow the existing digital and artificial intelligence divides in societies and economies between and within developed and developing countries, with specific consideration given to the needs, priorities and conditions of developing countries, and therefore cognizant of the importance of enhancing international cooperation and strengthening capacity-building,

Recognizing also the criticality of enhanced understanding and awareness of the implications of artificial intelligence in the military domain, including through knowledge exchange and the sharing of good practices and lessons learned among all States,

Acknowledging the contribution of United Nations entities and international and regional organizations, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross, academia, civil society, the scientific and technical community and the private sector, in supporting States in understanding and addressing the peace and security implications of the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain, and underlining the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach,

Acknowledging also national, regional, subregional and global efforts undertaken to address the potential risks to international peace and security that could be raised by the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain, including through the development of relevant national strategies, legislation, principles, norms, policies and measures, and recognizing the importance of promoting dialogue at all levels,

Taking note of the discussions currently taking place in the Disarmament Commission on recommendations on common understandings related to emerging

technologies in the context of international security and in the Conference on Disarmament, and noting also the meetings of the Security Council on artificial intelligence and international peace and security, held on 18 July 2023, 19 December 2024, 4 April 2025 and 24 September 2025,

Acknowledging the urgent need for the international community to address the challenges and concerns raised by emerging technologies in the area of lethal autonomous weapons systems, in particular through the ongoing and valuable work of the Group of Governmental Experts on Emerging Technologies in the Area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems, established under the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons, 2  and welcoming the progress made in these discussions, as well as taking note of the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 78/241 of 22 December 2023 on lethal autonomous weapons systems,3 as well as the need to ensure complementarity between discussions in this regard and discussions on the broader security implications of artificial intelligence in the military domain,

Recognizing the value of an inclusive multilateral exchange of views on artificial intelligence in the military domain and its implications for international peace and security,

1. Reaffirms that international law, including the Charter of the United Nations, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, applies to matters governed by it that occur throughout all stages of the life cycle of artificial intelligence, including systems enabled by artificial intelligence, in the military domain;

2. Notes the report of the Secretary-General, 4  submitted pursuant to resolution 79/239, on the opportunities and challenges posed to international peace and security by the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain, with specific focus on areas other than lethal autonomous weapon systems, which reflects various views of the international community;

3. Invites States to take into account the observations and conclusions contained in the report of the Secretary-General when discussing the implications of artificial intelligence in the military domain, mindful of both the opportunities and challenges, including from the humanitarian, legal, security, technological and ethical perspectives identified therein, with regard to international peace and security;

4. Encourages States to continue to pursue national, regional, subregional and global efforts to address the opportunities and challenges, including from humanitarian, legal, security, technological and ethical perspectives, related to the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain;

5. Also encourages States to continue to assess implications of the application of artificial intelligence in the military domain for international peace and security, including through a multilateral and multi-stakeholder dialogue in relevant international forums;

6. Encourages the Secretariat and other entities of the United Nations system, through voluntary contributions, to facilitate knowledge-sharing and raise awareness of the implications of artificial intelligence in the military domain for international peace and security, such as by convening a series of exchanges on this topic;
