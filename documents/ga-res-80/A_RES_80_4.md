General Assembly Distr.: General 31 October 2025

Eightieth session Agenda item 38 Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 29 October 2025

[without reference to a Main Committee (A/80/L.6)]

80/4. Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba

The General Assembly,

Determined to encourage strict compliance with the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,

Reaffirming, among other principles, the sovereign equality of States, non‑intervention and non‑interference in their internal affairs and freedom of international trade and navigation, which are also enshrined in many international legal instruments,

Recalling the statements of the Heads of State or Government of Latin America and the Caribbean at the Summits of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States regarding the need to put an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba,

Concerned about the continued promulgation and application by Member States of laws and regulations, such as that promulgated on 12 March 1996 known as “the Helms-Burton Act”, the extraterritorial effects of which affect the sovereignty of other States, the legitimate interests of entities or persons under their jurisdiction and the freedom of trade and navigation,

Taking note of declarations and resolutions of different intergovernmental forums, bodies and Governments that express the rejection by the international community and public opinion of the promulgation and application of measures of the kind referred to above,

Recalling its resolutions 47/19 of 24 November 1992, 48/16 of 3 November 1993, 49/9 of 26 October 1994, 50/10 of 2 November 1995, 51/17 of 12 November

A/RES/80/4 Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba

1996, 52/10 of 5 November 1997, 53/4 of 14 October 1998, 54/21 of 9 November 1999, 55/20 of 9 November 2000, 56/9 of 27 November 2001, 57/11 of 12 November 2002, 58/7 of 4 November 2003, 59/11 of 28 October 2004, 60/12 of 8 November 2005, 61/11 of 8 November 2006, 62/3 of 30 October 2007, 63/7 of 29 October 2008,

Recalling also the measures adopted by the Executive of the United States of America in 2015 and 2016 to modify several aspects of the application of the embargo, which contrast with the measures applied since 2017 to reinforce its implementation,

Concerned that, since the adoption of its resolutions 47/19, 48/16, 49/9, 50/10,
51/17, 52/10, 53/4, 54/21, 55/20, 56/9, 57/11, 58/7, 59/11, 60/12, 61/11, 62/3, 63/7,
64/6, 65/6, 66/6, 67/4, 68/8, 69/5, 70/5, 71/5, 72/4, 73/8, 74/7, 75/289, 77/7, 78/7 and 79/7, the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba is still in place, and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries,

1. Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of resolution 79/7;1

2. Reiterates its call upon all States to refrain from promulgating and applying laws and measures of the kind referred to in the preamble to the present resolution, in conformity with their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law, which, inter alia, reaffirm the freedom of trade and navigation;

4. Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the appropriate organs and agencies of the United Nations system, to prepare a report on the implementation of the present resolution in the light of the purposes and principles of the Charter and international law and to submit it to the General Assembly at its eighty-first session;

5. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its eighty-first session the item entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba”.
