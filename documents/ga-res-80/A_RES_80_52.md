[on the report of the First Committee (A/80/534, para. 7)]

80/52. Implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 63/71 of 2 December 2008 on the Convention on Cluster Munitions and 70/54 of 7 December 2015, 71/45 of 5 December 2016, 72/54 of 4 December 2017, 73/54 of 5 December 2018, 74/62 of 12 December 2019, 75/62 of 7 December 2020, 76/47 of 6 December 2021, 77/79 of 7 December 2022, 78/32 of 4 December 2023 and 79/58 of 2 December 2024 on the implementation of the Convention,

Reaffirming its determination to put an end for all time to the suffering and casualties caused by cluster munitions at the time of their use, when they fail to function as intended or when they are abandoned,

Deploring the use of cluster munitions in recent and ongoing conflicts and the related significant increase in civilian casualties, and calling upon those who continue to use cluster munitions to cease any such activity immediately,

Conscious that cluster munition remnants kill or maim civilians, including women and children, obstruct economic and social development, including through the loss of livelihood, impede post-conflict reconciliation, rehabilitation and reconstruction, delay or prevent the return of refugees and internally displaced persons, can have a negative impact on national and international peacebuilding and humanitarian assistance efforts, and have other severe consequences for many years after use,

Concerned about the dangers presented by the large national stockpiles of cluster munitions retained and also transferred for operational use, and determined to ensure their rapid destruction,

Underscoring the important achievement of the completion by all States Parties to the Convention of their article 3 obligations,

Recognizing the impact of cluster munitions on women, men, girls and boys and the importance of relevant States providing adequate, gender- and age-sensitive assistance to victims of cluster munitions,

Believing it necessary to contribute effectively in an efficient, coordinated manner to resolving the challenge of removing cluster munition remnants located throughout the world, and to ensure their destruction,

Mindful of the need to adequately coordinate efforts undertaken in various forums, including through the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 1 to address the rights and adequately provide for the needs of victims of various types of weapons, and resolved to avoid discrimination among victims of various types of weapons,

Reaffirming that in cases not covered by the Convention on Cluster Munitions 2 or by other international agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and authority of the principles of international law, derived from established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the dictates of public conscience,

Welcoming the steps taken nationally, regionally and globally in recent years aimed at prohibiting, restricting or suspending the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of cluster munitions, and welcoming also in this regard that, since 2014, all Central American States have joined the Convention, thus fulfilling their aspiration to become the first cluster munitions-free region in the world,

Stressing the role of public conscience in furthering the principles of humanity, as evidenced by the global call for an end to civilian suffering caused by cluster munitions, and recognizing the efforts to that end undertaken by the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Cluster Munition Coalition and numerous other non‑governmental organizations around the world,

Recognizing the need to uphold humanitarian disarmament norms in the context of the Convention on Cluster Munitions as an enabler of human rights and sustainable development, in line with ongoing global initiatives to strengthen these commitments, and noting the Secretary-General’s initiative in this regard,

Noting that a total of 124 States have joined the Convention, 112 as States Parties, following the accession of Vanuatu, and 12 as signatories,

Welcoming the accession of Vanuatu to the Convention on Cluster Munitions on 5 September 2025, making it the 112th State Party effective 1 March 2026,

Emphasizing the need to make further efforts in accelerating the universalization process, and acknowledging the call by States Parties and other stakeholders, as a matter of priority, to all States that have not yet done so, to ratify or otherwise accede to the Convention and, in particular in the current context, to prevent any withdrawal, to promote universal adherence to and strict observance of the Convention’s norms, including to discourage, in every possible way, the use, development, production, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions,

Noting that the thirteenth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions deeply regretted the withdrawal of Lithuania effective 6 March 2025, exercising its national sovereignty pursuant to article 20 of the Convention,

Recalling the outcome of the second Review Conference of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, held in Geneva from 25 to 27 November 2020 and on 20 and 21 September 2021, and in particular the adoption of the Lausanne Declaration entitled “Protecting lives, empowering victims, enabling development” and the Lausanne Action Plan 2021–2026 3  to support the full and effective implementation of the Convention,

Welcoming the dialogue undertaken by the President of the thirteenth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions with States not Parties to the Convention, in support of universal adherence to the Convention,

Welcoming also the initiative of the President of the thirteenth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions to host the South-East Asia and Pacific Regional Workshop on the Convention, held on 18 and 19 March 2025 in Manila,

Welcoming further measures to improve transparency, reporting and initiatives to assist States in better understanding the benefits of reporting, including that it facilitates informed decision-making on the implementation of the Convention, while noting that transparency reporting by States Parties is a requirement under article 7 of the Convention,

Noting that, pursuant to the mandate of the twelfth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, the President of the thirteenth Meeting of States Parties to the Convention, with the support of the Implementation Support Unit of the Convention, consulted further and convened a series of dialogues open to States Parties and other stakeholders, in which participants reflected on the concerns and challenges facing the Convention and its norms, and noting also the recommendations for ways forward presented at the thirteenth Meeting of States Parties,

Recognizing the importance of full involvement and equal opportunities for the meaningful participation of women and men in disarmament processes, policy and programming decisions related to the Convention,

1. Urges all States not Parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions to ratify or accede to it as soon as possible, and all States Parties to promote adherence to the Convention through bilateral, subregional and multilateral contacts, outreach and other means;

2. Stresses the importance of the full and effective implementation of and compliance with the Convention, including through the implementation of the Lausanne Action Plan, as appropriate;

3. Expresses grave concern regarding the number of allegations, reports or documented evidence of the transfer and use of cluster munitions in different parts of the world, and at the related significant increase in civilian casualties and other consequences that impede the achievement of sustainable development;

4. Urges all States Parties to provide the Secretary-General with complete and timely information as required under article 7 of the Convention in order to promote transparency and compliance with the Convention;

5. Invites all States that have not ratified the Convention or acceded to it to provide, on a voluntary basis, information that could make the clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants and related activities more effective;

6. Reiterates the invitation to States not Parties to participate in a continued dialogue on issues relevant to the Convention in order to enhance its humanitarian impact and to promote its universalization, as well as to engage in a military-to- military dialogue in order to address specific security issues related to cluster munitions;

7. Reiterates its invitation and encouragement to all States Parties, interested States, the United Nations, other relevant international organizations or institutions, regional organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Cluster Munition Coalition and other relevant non‑governmental organizations to participate in the upcoming formal meetings under the Convention;

8. Invites and encourages all interested States, the United Nations, other relevant international organizations or institutions, regional organizations, the International Committee of the Red Cross and relevant non‑governmental organizations to attend the third Review Conference of the Convention on Cluster Munitions, to be held in Vientiane during the week of 14 to 18 September 2026, and to participate in the future programme of meetings of the States Parties to the Convention;

9. Requests the Secretary-General to convene the third Review Conference of the Convention and to continue to render the necessary assistance and to provide such services as may be necessary to fulfil the tasks entrusted to him under the Convention and in the relevant decisions of the Meetings of States Parties and the second Review Conference;

10. Urgently calls upon States Parties and participating States to address issues arising from outstanding dues, including options to ensure sustainable financing for all formal meetings and prompt payment of respective shares of the estimated costs;

11. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its eighty-first session, under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item entitled “Implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions”.
