Eightieth session Agenda item 105

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 1 December 2025

[on the report of the First Committee (A/80/534, para. 7)]

80/70. Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty

The General Assembly,

Reiterating that the cessation of nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions constitutes an effective nuclear disarmament and non‑proliferation measure, and convinced that this is a meaningful step in the realization of a systematic process for achieving nuclear disarmament,

Mindful that 2025 marks 80 years since nuclear weapons were first used with devastating consequences, marking the advent of the nuclear age,

Recalling that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, adopted by the General Assembly by its resolution 50/245 of 10 September 1996, was opened for signature on 24 September 1996,

Stressing that a universal and effectively verifiable Treaty constitutes a fundamental instrument in the field of nuclear disarmament and non‑proliferation and will be a major contribution to international peace and security,

Stressing also the vital importance and urgency of achieving the entry into force of the Treaty, and affirming its resolute determination, 29 years after the Treaty was opened for signature, to achieve its entry into force,

Deeply concerned by the long-standing lack of progress towards the ratification of the Treaty from the remaining nine annex 2 States, which continues to delay the entry into force of the Treaty, with the associated risks that nuclear testing could be resumed,

Encouraged by the signing of the Treaty by 187 States, including 41 of the 44 whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, and welcoming the ratification of the Treaty by 178 States, including 35 of the 44 whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, among which there are 2 nuclear-weapon States,

Recognizing the sustained efforts by the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization to promote the universalization of the Treaty, and encouraging their continuation,

Recalling its resolution 79/77 of 2 December 2024,

Recalling also the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and recommendations for follow-on actions of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 in which the Conference, inter alia, reaffirmed the vital importance of the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as a core element of the international nuclear disarmament and non‑proliferation regime and included specific actions to be taken in support of the entry into force of the Treaty,

Recalling further the Final Declaration adopted by the fourteenth Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, held in New York on 26 September 2025, convened pursuant to article XIV of the Treaty, and recalling the Joint Ministerial Statement on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted at the ministerial meeting held in New York on 24 September 2024,2

Noting the contribution of diverse and inclusive participation in building and sustaining momentum for the universalization and entry into force of the Treaty, including through the Youth Group of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization,

Welcoming the sustained efforts within the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization for the equal participation of both men and women in its staff and its capacity-building programmes, including the Commission’s mentoring programme to empower the next generation of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and encouraging the continuation of such efforts,

Welcoming also the continuing progress in the development of the Treaty’s verification regime, which advances the Treaty’s primary non‑proliferation and disarmament objective, and the establishment of 307 certified facilities of the International Monitoring System network,

Welcoming further the renewed focus on ensuring the continued operation and long-term sustainability of the verification regime,

Recognizing the civil and scientific benefits provided by the Treaty’s global monitoring system,

1. Stresses the vital importance and urgency of signature and ratification, without delay and without conditions, in order to achieve the earliest entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty;3

2. Welcomes the contributions by the signatory States to the work of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, in particular its efforts to fulfil its mandate to ensure that the verification regime of the Treaty will be capable of meeting the verification requirements of the Treaty upon its entry into force, in accordance with article IV of the Treaty, and encourages their continuation;

3. Underlines the need to maintain momentum towards the completion of all elements of the verification regime and put into place plans and adequate resources for its long-term sustainability;

4. Urges all States not to carry out nuclear-weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions, to maintain their moratoriums in this regard and to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the Treaty, while stressing that these measures do not have the same permanent and legally binding effect as the entry into force of the Treaty;

5. Reiterates its condemnation of the six nuclear tests conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in violation of relevant Security Council resolutions, 4  urges full compliance with the obligations under those resolutions, including that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea abandon its nuclear weapons programme and not conduct any further nuclear tests, reaffirms its support for the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner, welcomes all efforts and dialogue to this end, and encourages all parties to continue diplomatic efforts;

6. Urges all States to refrain from any action that may hamper progress towards the entry into force of the Treaty and its universalization;

7. Also urges all States that have not yet signed or ratified, or that have signed but not yet ratified, the Treaty, in particular the nine whose ratification is needed for its entry into force, to sign and ratify it as soon as possible and to accelerate their ratification processes with a view to ensuring their earliest successful conclusion;

8. Encourages further expressions from among the remaining States whose ratification is needed for the Treaty to enter into force of their intention to pursue and complete the ratification process;

9. Welcomes the reappointment of Robert Floyd as the Executive Secretary of the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization by States members of the governing body of the Preparatory Commission;

10. Urges all States to remain seized of the issue at the highest political level and, where in a position to do so, to promote adherence to the Treaty through bilateral and joint outreach, seminars and other means;

11. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its eighty-first session the item entitled “Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty”.
