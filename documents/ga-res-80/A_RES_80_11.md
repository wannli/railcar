Reaffirming that development, peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing,

Reaffirming its deep concern at the high human cost and suffering caused by armed conflicts, and expressing grave alarm about the significant number of simultaneous security and humanitarian crises that the world currently faces, and the strain that this places on the resources of the United Nations system,

Recognizing that investing in conflict prevention is a highly cost-effective solution and results in saving lives, stabilizing economies and reducing the need for costly military responses,

Recognizing also the vital role of the United Nations in preventing conflicts, in assisting parties to conflicts to end hostilities and emerge towards recovery, reconstruction and development and in mobilizing sustained international attention and assistance,

1 Including General Assembly resolution 60/180 and Security Council resolution 1645 (2005),

(2020).

Recognizing further that conflict prevention should be nationally led and owned, and reaffirming that Member States bear the primary responsibility for preventing conflict and building peace and for addressing the root causes of violence and conflict in their countries, and that national efforts to build and sustain peace contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security,

Recalling that peacebuilding is an inherently political process aimed at preventing the outbreak, escalation, recurrence or continuation of conflict, and further recognizing that peacebuilding encompasses a wide range of political, development, and human rights programmes and mechanisms,

Recognizing the importance of ensuring impact of United Nations system-wide activities, including planning and joint analysis, in support of peacebuilding and sustaining peace efforts, and bearing in mind in this regard the role of the three core components of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture in leveraging the entire United Nations system and the importance of greater synergies between them, while reiterating in this regard the important role that effective and responsive leadership in the United Nations in the field can play in peacebuilding and sustaining peace,

Recognizing also the contribution of peace operations in efforts to advance peacebuilding and sustaining peace, and mindful of the ongoing review of the Secretary-General on the future of all forms of United Nations peace operations,

Reaffirming the primary responsibility of national Governments and authorities in identifying, driving and directing priorities, strategies and activities for peacebuilding and sustaining peace, and emphasizing the importance of ensuring that the needs of all segments of society are taken into account, while reiterating the importance of partnerships with relevant stakeholders, including regional and subregional organizations, international financial institutions, civil society organizations, local peacebuilding stakeholders and, where relevant, the private sector, in supporting national peacebuilding priorities,

Reaffirming also, in the context of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on 31 October 2000, the important role of women in peacebuilding and sustaining peace, and recognizing that the full, equal, meaningful and safe participation of women at all decision-making levels in efforts to prevent, resolve and rebuild from conflict is important to achieve durable solutions and long-term stability,

Reaffirming further, in the context of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 2250 (2015) on 9 December 2015, that the full, effective, safe and meaningful participation of youth is critical to maintain and promote international peace and security through peacebuilding and sustaining peace efforts,
