1. 
We, the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives, met in

partnerships” with the objective of advancing the development agenda of the 
landlocked developing countries. 
2. 
We welcome the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing 
Countries for the Decade 2024–2034 adopted by the General Assembly on 24 December 
2024,1 which builds on the progress achieved under the Almaty Programme of Action: 
Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New 
Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit 
Developing Countries 2  and the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked 
Developing Countries for the Decade 2014–20243 and provides a renewed and action-
oriented framework to support the efforts of landlocked developing countries in 
achieving sustainable development. 
 
I. 
Global context and shared commitments 
3. 
We gather at a critical juncture marked by overlapping global challenges, 
including geopolitical tensions and conflicts, food and energy crises, high 
transportation and trade costs, high interest rates, inflation, high indebtedness, climate 
change, disasters, biodiversity loss, desertification, melting glaciers and pollution. 
4. 
We stress the specific needs and challenges faced by landlocked developing 
countries due to the lack of direct territorial access to the sea, obstacles to transport 
and communication, long distances from major markets, cumbersome transit 
procedures and the lack of adequate, safe, affordable, accessible infrastructure, and 
recognize the need for strengthened international solidarity to support their structural 
transformation, industrialization, economic diversification and full integration into 
the regional and global economy. 
5. 
We recall that 2025 was proclaimed by the General Assembly as the 
International Year of Peace and Trust,4 and recognize that there can be no sustainable 
development without peace and no peace without sustainable development – that is 
also relevant for landlocked developing countries. 
6. 
We recognize that, despite some positive results in certain areas of the Vienna 
Programme of Action, progress fell short, and note with concern that a severe 
financing deficit, in particular for infrastructure, limited data and technical capacity 
constraints undermined progress in achieving the goals and targets set out in the 
Vienna Programme of Action. 
7. 
We further reaffirm our commitment to enhancing our efforts for the full and 
timely implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 5 and its 
Sustainable Development Goals, the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change6 and the Paris Agreement,7 the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 
Reduction 2015–2030,8 the New Urban Agenda9 and the Convention on Biological

II. Implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked 
Developing Countries for the Decade 2024–2034 
13. We strongly commit ourselves to the full implementation of the Awaza 
Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2024–2034 
throughout the coming decade in line with its five mutually reinforcing priority areas: 
 
(a) 
Structural transformation and science, technology and innovation;

(b) 
Trade, trade facilitation and regional integration; 
 
(c) 
Transit, transport and connectivity; 
 
(d) 
Enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing 
vulnerability to climate change and disasters; 
 
(e) 
Means of implementation. 
14. We reaffirm our commitment to advancing the concrete deliverables outlined in 
the Awaza Programme of Action, with respect to establishing regional agriculture 
research hubs, based on interest expressed by some countries; creating a high-level 
panel of experts on freedom of transit for landlocked developing countries; and 
exploring the establishment of an infrastructure investment finance facility for 
landlocked developing countries. 
15. We emphasize the significance of declaring the United Nations Decade of 
Sustainable Transport for the 10-year period beginning on 1 January 2026, in 
particular for landlocked developing countries and transit countries, and look forward 
to an implementation plan for the Decade. 
16. We stress the importance of developing trade-related physical and digital 
infrastructure and facilitating inclusive, equitable and affordable connectivity for 
landlocked developing countries, and in this regard we invite multilateral 
development banks to increase investment in infrastructure, including roads, railways, 
waterways and ports, energy transit and connectivity infrastructure, as well as digital 
infrastructure, such as fibre-optic cables and satellite-based systems. 
 
Partnerships and support mechanisms 
17. We invite the landlocked developing countries, transit countries, their 
development partners, the United Nations system and all other relevant stakeholders 
to implement the relevant actions, agreed upon in the Awaza Programme of Action in 
its five priority areas, in a coordinated, coherent and expeditious manner consistent 
with national priorities. 
18. We invite the governing bodies of the United Nations funds and programmes 
and other multilateral organizations, including multilateral development banks and 
other international and regional financial institutions, as well as the World Trade 
Organization, to contribute to the implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action 
and to integrate it into their work programmes, as appropriate and in accordance with 
their relevant mandates. We also acknowledge the role of multilateral development 
banks in catalysing private investment and encourage the provision of increased 
concessional finance for infrastructure development to landlocked developing 
countries, encouraging them to enhance access to digital trade finance to help to 
narrow the trade finance gap. 
19. We welcome the growing role of South-South and triangular cooperation, as a 
complement to, and not a substitute for, North-South cooperation, peer learning and 
regional integration as enablers for resilience-building, innovation and cross-border 
cooperation. 
 
Governance, accountability and monitoring 
20. We underscore that national leadership and ownership of development strategies 
and policies of landlocked developing countries, transit countries and development 
partners must be ensured during the whole process of implementation, follow-up and 
monitoring.

21. We call for closer coordination between the Office of the High Representative 
for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small 
Island Developing States and United Nations country teams in landlocked developing 
countries, as an important tool for follow-up to and review of the implementation of 
provisions of the Awaza Programme of Action, underlining that the Office should be 
provided with adequate resources to fulfil its mandate, including through the existing 
trust fund. We also stress the critical importance of the more proactive role of United 
Nations agencies, including through the United Nations resident coordinators and 
country teams, in mobilizing all stakeholders to help Governments of landlocked 
developing countries to address the challenges caused by those countries’ structural 
constraints. 
22. We emphasize that efficient and mutually complementary follow-up and 
monitoring mechanisms aligned with existing global frameworks and adapted at the 
national, subregional, regional and global levels are crucial for the successful 
implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action. 
 
III. Conclusion and call to action 
23. We declare our firm resolve to act urgently and collectively to deliver the 
commitments made in the Awaza Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing 
Countries for the Decade 2024–2034. 
24. We request the Secretary-General to ensure the full mobilization and 
coordination of all relevant parts of the United Nations system to facilitate 
coordinated implementation and coherence in the follow-up to and monitoring of the 
Awaza Programme of Action at the national, subregional, regional and global levels. 
We call upon relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and 
invite international organizations and relevant regional and subregional organizations 
to integrate the Awaza Programme of Action into their programmes of work, as 
appropriate, within their respective mandates. 
25. We express our deepest appreciation to the Government and people of 
Turkmenistan for their generous hospitality and for hosting the Conference in an 
excellent manner in the spirit of global cooperation and solidarity.
