Eightieth session Agenda item 7 Organization of work, adoption of the agenda and allocation of items

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 19 September 2025

[without reference to a Main Committee (A/80/L.2/Rev.1)]

80/1. Participation by the State of Palestine during the eightieth session

The General Assembly,

Expressing concern regarding situations in which representatives referred to in section 11 of the Agreement between the United Nations and the United States of America regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations1 are prevented from participating in the meetings of the General Assembly,

Regretting, in this regard, the decision of the United States of America to deny visas to and revoke visas from representatives of the State of Palestine ahead of the eightieth session of the General Assembly, thus preventing them from participating in the meetings of the United Nations, and seeking the immediate reversal of this decision,

Taking note of the meeting of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country of 12 September 2025, and the statements made therein, including the position of the United Nations Legal Counsel,

Recalling its relevant resolutions regarding the question of Palestine,

Recalling also the Headquarters Agreement,

1. Decides, without setting a precedent for future general debates and mandated high-level meetings and while stressing that the representatives of the State of Palestine should be able to participate in person in the relevant meetings at the United Nations in New York, that:

(a) The State of Palestine may submit a pre‑recorded statement of its President, which will be played in the General Assembly Hall during the general debate of the Assembly at its eightieth session after introduction by its representative who is physically present in the Assembly Hall;

(b) The State of Palestine may deliver statements by means of videoconference or submit a pre‑recorded statement at the meetings of the High-level International Conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution;

(c) The State of Palestine may submit a pre‑recorded statement of its President or other high-level representative at any high-level meeting or United Nations conference and at international conferences and meetings convened under the auspices of the General Assembly or, as appropriate, under the auspices of other organs of the United Nations, if representatives of the State of Palestine are prevented from participating in the meetings of the United Nations;

2. Also decides that, in addition to the records of the general debate of the General Assembly at its eightieth session, the President of the General Assembly will circulate as a document of the Assembly the statement referred to in paragraph 1 (a) above, delivered by means of a pre‑recorded statement during the general debate and submitted to the President no later than the day on which the pre‑recorded statement is played in the Assembly Hall;

3. Further decides that these procedures shall apply only during the eightieth session.
