Technical Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification, as well as the reports of the aforementioned groups of governmental experts,6

Recalling its resolution 78/239 of 22 December 2023, in which it welcomed the report of the Group of Governmental Experts to further consider nuclear disarmament verification issues,7 and, inter alia, requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States and encouraged Member States to continue work on nuclear disarmament verification issues,

Recalling also the report of the Secretary-General containing the substantive views of Member States on the report of the Group of Governmental Experts to further consider nuclear disarmament verification issues,8

Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to resolution 79/240 of 24 December 2024, containing possible options for the establishment of a Group of Scientific and Technical Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification within the United Nations,9 which took into account the views submitted by Member States in writing and through three informal in-person meetings,

Recalling its resolution 78/22 of 4 December 2023, in which it, inter alia, invited Member States to continue efforts to apply developments in science and technology for disarmament-related purposes, including the verification of disarmament, arms control and non‑proliferation instruments, and to make disarmament-related technologies available to interested States,

Reaffirming the shared commitment to further progress in nuclear disarmament and non‑proliferation, and that all States Members of the United Nations should be enabled to actively engage on an equal footing to this end,

Recognizing that measures in the field of disarmament should be undertaken as a matter of urgency with a view to halting and reversing the arms race and to give the necessary impetus to efforts designed to achieve genuine disarmament leading to general and complete disarmament under effective international control,

Recalling the unequivocal undertaking of nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament, to which all States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons10 are committed under article VI thereof,11

Recalling also that all States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons have committed to the principles of irreversibility, verifiability and transparency in relation to the implementation of their treaty obligations, 12

Reaffirming that, since the process of disarmament affects the vital security interests of all States, they must all be actively concerned with and supportive of the measures of disarmament and arms limitation, which have an essential part to play in maintaining and strengthening international security,

Recognizing that the decisive factor for achieving real measures of disarmament is the political will of States, especially the nuclear-weapon States,

12 Ibid., action 2 of the action plan.

Recognizing also that credible multilateral nuclear disarmament verification capabilities will be instrumental to providing assurance of compliance with nuclear disarmament agreements for the achievement and maintenance of a world without nuclear weapons,

Underlining that work on nuclear disarmament verification is not an end in itself and is not a prerequisite, precondition or substitute for progress in nuclear disarmament, and that such work should aim to promote and facilitate progress in nuclear disarmament,

Recognizing that, while the form and modalities of the verification to be provided for in any specific agreement entered into by contracting parties depend upon and should be determined by the purposes, scope and nature of the agreement, collaborative multilateral work on tools, technologies, methodologies and procedures that could further contribute to nuclear disarmament verification can provide benefits in support of the long-term goal of nuclear disarmament,

Convinced that identifying and developing practical and effective measures of nuclear disarmament verification can foster confidence among Member States in this key area for peace and security,

Convinced also of the particular relevance of enabling States, on a voluntary basis, to participate in nuclear disarmament verification discussions,

Recognizing that work on nuclear disarmament verification must conform to applicable international legal nuclear disarmament and non‑proliferation obligations, national safety and security requirements and the need to protect otherwise sensitive information,

Mindful of the role of verification in existing bilateral and multilateral disarmament, non‑proliferation and arms control agreements, and of the need to avoid any possible duplication of efforts so that any further work on nuclear disarmament verification builds on the existing accumulated scientific and technical knowledge and capabilities, especially in the area of nuclear verification and safeguards, keeping in mind their competence and mandate,

Aware that a considerable amount of knowledge and positive contributions on nuclear disarmament verification has already been assembled by past and ongoing initiatives and partnerships among Member States, and stressing the importance of incorporating, as appropriate, their experiences, knowledge and lessons learned in future multilateral discussions on the topic in the context of the United Nations,

Noting the fundamental importance of disarmament education and capacity- building to address nuclear disarmament verification challenges and related issues,

Underlining that equal opportunities for equitable geographical representation and participation should be provided for in nuclear disarmament verification education, training and capacity-building, taking into account the special needs of interested developing countries, upon their request, to participate in the relevant efforts,

Noting the contribution of civil society and academic and research communities to nuclear disarmament verification,

Underlining that equal opportunities for women and men should be provided for in nuclear disarmament verification education, training and capacity-building,

participating in their personal capacity and without prejudice to national positions in future negotiations;
