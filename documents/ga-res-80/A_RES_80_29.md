Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 1 December 2025

[on the report of the First Committee (A/80/534, para. 7)]

80/29. Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels

The General Assembly,

Recalling its resolutions 48/75 J of 16 December 1993, 49/75 O of 15 December 1994, 50/70 L of 12 December 1995, 51/45 Q of 10 December 1996, 52/38 Q of 9 December 1997, 53/77 P of 4 December 1998, 54/54 M of 1 December 1999,
55/33 P of 20 November 2000, 56/24 I of 29 November 2001, 57/77 of 22 November 2002, 58/39 of 8 December 2003, 59/88 of 3 December 2004, 60/75 of 8 December 2005, 61/82 of 6 December 2006, 62/44 of 5 December 2007, 63/44 of 2 December 2008, 64/42 of 2 December 2009, 65/46 of 8 December 2010, 66/37 of 2 December 2011, 67/62 of 3 December 2012, 68/56 of 5 December 2013, 69/47 of 2 December 2014, 70/44 of 7 December 2015, 71/41 of 5 December 2016, 72/35 of 4 December 2017, 73/34 of 5 December 2018, 74/38 of 12 December 2019, 75/50 of 7 December 2020, 76/42 of 6 December 2021, 77/61 of 7 December 2022, 78/37 of 4 December 2023 and 79/26 of 2 December 2024,

Recognizing the crucial role of conventional arms control in promoting regional and international peace and security,

Recognizing also the importance of equitable representation of women in arms control discussions and negotiations,

Convinced that conventional arms control needs to be pursued primarily in the regional and subregional contexts since most threats to peace and security in the post- cold-war era arise mainly among States located in the same region or subregion,

Aware that the preservation of a balance in the defence capabilities of States at the lowest level of armaments would contribute to peace and stability and should be a prime objective of conventional arms control,

Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels

Desirous of promoting agreements to strengthen regional peace and security at the lowest possible level of armaments and military forces,

Noting with particular interest the initiatives taken in this regard in different regions of the world, in particular the consultations among a number of Latin American countries and the proposals for conventional arms control made in the context of South Asia, and recognizing, in the context of this subject, the relevance and value of conventional arms control in regional security,

Believing that militarily significant States and States with larger military capabilities have a special responsibility in promoting such agreements for regional security,

Believing also that an important objective of conventional arms control in regions of tension should be to prevent the possibility of military attack launched by surprise and to avoid aggression,

1. Decides to give urgent consideration to the issues involved in conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels;

2. Requests the Disarmament Commission to consider the formulation of principles that can serve as a framework for regional agreements on conventional arms control, and looks forward to a report of the Commission on this subject;

3. Requests the Secretary-General, in the meantime, to seek the views of Member States on the subject and to submit a report to the General Assembly at its eighty-first session;

4. Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its eighty-first session, under the item entitled “General and complete disarmament”, the sub-item entitled “Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels”.
