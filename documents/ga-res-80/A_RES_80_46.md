Bearing in mind that civilians, particularly women and children, account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict and armed violence,

Recognizing the legitimate political, security, economic and commercial interests of States in the international trade in conventional arms,

Underlining the urgent need to prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms, including small arms and light weapons, and to prevent their diversion to the illicit market, or for unauthorized end use or end users, including through improvements to stockpile management, thereby preventing the exacerbation of armed violence, the commission of terrorist acts and the violation of international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law,

Emphasizing the responsibility of all States, in accordance with their respective international and regional obligations and commitments, to effectively regulate the international trade in conventional arms,

Recalling the contribution made by the Programme of Action to Prevent,

Recognizing the negative impact of the illicit and unregulated trade in conventional arms and related ammunition on the lives of women, men, girls and boys, and that the Treaty was the first international agreement to identify and call upon States to address the link between conventional arms transfers and the risk of serious acts of gender-based violence and serious acts of violence against women and children,

Recognizing also the important role that civil society organizations, including non‑governmental organizations, industry and relevant international organizations play, by raising awareness, in efforts to prevent and eradicate the illicit and unregulated trade in conventional arms, including in preventing their diversion, and in supporting the implementation of the Treaty,
