The General Assembly, 
 
Recalling its resolution 78/10 of 21 November 2023, in which it decided to 
include in the provisional agenda of its eightieth session the sub-item entitled 
“Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal”, and 
recalling also its prior decision to consider the sub-item every two years, in advance 
of the Summer and Winter Olympic Games,  
 
Recalling also its resolution 48/11 of 25 October 1993, which, inter alia, revived 
the ancient Greek tradition of ekecheiria (“Olympic Truce”) calling for a truce during 
the Olympic Games to encourage a peaceful environment and ensure safe passage, 
access and participation for athletes and relevant persons at the Games, thereby 
mobilizing the youth of the world to the cause of peace,  
 
Recalling further that the core concept of ekecheiria, historically, has been the 
cessation of hostilities from seven days before until seven days after the Olympic 
Games, which, according to the legendary oracle of Delphi, was to replace the cycle 
of conflict with a friendly athletic competition every four years,  
 
Recognizing the valuable contribution of sport in promoting education, 
sustainable development, peace, cooperation, solidarity, fairness, social inclusion and 
health at the local, regional and international levels, and noting that, as declared in 
the 2005 World Summit Outcome, 1  sports can contribute to an atmosphere of 
tolerance and understanding among peoples and nations,
