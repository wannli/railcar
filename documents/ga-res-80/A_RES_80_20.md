Recognizing the common interest of all humankind in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes,

Seriously concerned about the possibility of an arms race in outer space and of outer space turning into an arena for military confrontation, and bearing in mind the importance of articles III and IV of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies,1

Conscious that the prevention of an arms race in outer space would avert a grave danger to international peace and security,

Reaffirming that practical measures should be examined and taken in the search for agreements to prevent an arms race in outer space in a common effort towards a community of shared future for humankind,

1 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 610, No. 8843.

Emphasizing the paramount importance of strict compliance with the existing legal regime providing for the peaceful use of outer space,

Reaffirming its recognition that the legal regime applicable to outer space by itself does not guarantee prevention of an arms race in outer space and that there is a need to consolidate and reinforce that regime,

Convinced that such measures could critically improve conditions for efficiently addressing the threat of an arms race in outer space, including the placement of weapons in outer space,

Welcoming, in this regard, the draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the threat or use of force against outer space objects, introduced by China and the Russian Federation at the Conference on Disarmament in 2008,2 and the submission of its updated version in 2014, 3

Considering that transparency and confidence-building measures in outer space activities are an integral part of the draft treaty referred to above,

Welcoming the substantive report4 adopted by consensus by the Group of Governmental Experts established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 77/250 of 30 December 2022,

Stressing the importance of the substantive report of the above-mentioned Group of Governmental Experts, which serves as a reference document for further measures and international negotiations on an international legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, including, inter alia, on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space,

Noting the establishment by the General Assembly in its decision 79/512 of 2 December 2024 of an open-ended working group and the sessions held by the group, and welcoming the adoption by consensus by the group of the agenda 5 and the indicative timetable for 2025–20286 and the beginning of its substantive work,

Stressing the importance of the political statements made by a number of States 7 that they would not be the first to place weapons in outer space,

1. Reaffirms the importance and urgency of the objective of preventing an arms race in outer space and the willingness of States to contribute to reaching this common goal;

2. Reiterates that the Conference on Disarmament, as the single multilateral negotiating forum on this subject,8 has the primary role in the negotiation of a multilateral agreement, or agreements, as appropriate, on the prevention of an arms race in outer space in all its aspects;

3. Urges an early commencement of substantive work based on the updated draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space and of the

4. Stresses that, while such an agreement is not yet concluded, other measures may contribute to ensuring that weapons are not placed in outer space;

5. Supports the efforts aimed at globalizing the international initiative not to be the first to place weapons of any kind in outer space;
